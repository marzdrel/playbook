title: Onboarding
---

Congratulations on joining Nebulab! We're glad to have you aboard, and we can't wait to see what
you will accomplish during your time here.

We know that joining a company such as Nebulab can be a little overwhelming: there's a lot of new
faces to memorize, a lot of projects to explore and a lot of policies to learn. Don't worry!
Our onboarding process is fully automated and spans over a few weeks.

During these first weeks [Donut](https://www.donut.com), our friendly robot helper, will guide you
through the intricacies of Nebulab and show you everything that you need to learn about both this
[Playbook][playbook] as well as our [Internal Playbook][internal-playbook].
