title: Onboarding
---

Congratulations on joining Nebulab! We're glad to have you aboard, and we can't wait to see what
you will accomplish during your time here.

We know that joining a company such as Nebulab can be a little overwhelming: there's a lot of new
faces to memorize, a lot of projects to explore and a lot of policies to learn. This is why we have
developed an onboarding process that will help you get comfortable with how we do things around
here.

## Choose your gear

The first thing you want to do is choose your hardware. We not only provide our employees with a
MacBook Pro, but also a wide range of accessories.

Head over to the [Benefits](/people-ops/benefits) page and make your choices!

## Set up your tools

Next up, you should set up your company accounts and install all the tools we use:

- Make sure you can sign into your work Google account, and that everything's in order both in
  Gmail and Google Calendar. You'll be using these extensively!
- Use your Google account to sign into [Slack](https://nebulab.slack.com).
- Install [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com), sign in, and make sure you can see all
  company-level projects and any client projects you've been assigned to.
- Sign into [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com/) and maybe download their mobile
  app too, so that you can easily submit expense reports when you're abroad.
- Check that you're part of the [Nebulab GitHub organization](https://github.com/nebulab) and
  update your company in your GitHub profile!

If you need any help, don't be afraid to reach out to the person who handled your onboarding!

## Meet your manager

Your manager will coordinate your work and they will be responsible for your personal and
professional growth. Our coaching practices are explained more thoroughly in
[Coaching and 1:1s](/personal-growth/coaching-and-one-on-ones).

When you join the company, your manager will reach out to schedule your first 1:1, where you'll get
to know each other and structure your relationship together. They will also set up a call with the
rest of your team, so that you can get to know the project and the people you'll be working with.

## Read this playbook

Finally, once you've completed all of the above, we suggest reading the rest of this playbook!

You don't have to do it all in one day, or even in one week: simply take the time you need to go
through the content and fully understand it.

Take notes on any the aspects that are not clear and ask your manager to clarify them or, better 
yet, [open a PR](/working-on-nebulab/playbook)!
