All of us, in our work, have direct relations with colleagues and stakeholders, such as clients, 
other development teams, members of the OSS community and other professionals. The relationship 
established with them is fundamental: we must always keep in mind all the values and standards that 
Nebulab aims to represent and uphold.

Working at Nebulab means investing in an all-round collaboration context. It is essential to support
