---

Everything we do for Solidus and our partners falls under the same vision: to empower a new
generation of eCommerce brands to stand out—brands that feel authentic, alive and sophisticated—and
we want to do this by giving them the tools and the expertise to launch beautifully crafted shopping
experiences.

Vision towards our clients + towards our team






To be an inspiring digital consulting firm that builds quality products by creating the best
workplace for web enthusiasts. 

Nebulab was founded by two developers and one designer with a shared desire: to create a company
that delivers exceptionally high-quality digital products. No compromises allowed.

Today Nebulab is a growing company of digital consulting experts specialized in designing,
developing, and maintaining high-quality eCommerce applications.

We strive to produce high-quality work basing our processes and company life on lean principles and
respect for the people we work with: our teammates, the Open Source community, and our clients.

## Teammates

We strongly believe in personal and professional growth, a sustainable pace, and a healthy work-life
balance. That’s the reason we aim at providing the best place to work: a place where learning and
sharing are possible, and benefits go along with a tailored growth path.

## Open Source

Getting involved in Open Source by learning, coding, and giving back is our way to succeed. This
endless cycle allows us to improve our skills, find new clients, and inspire others using Open
Source to do the same.

## Clients

We collaborate with companies that share our mindset and working values such as professionalism,
transparency, and a sense of mutual respect and cooperation. Our team of trusted, engaged, and
motivated individuals understand our clients' real needs and drive them to success through a
high level of empathy, autonomy, and technical skills.
