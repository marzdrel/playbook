title: Donuts
---

Once a week, [Donut](https://donut.com) will pair people in the #coffee channel. It will kick off
the conversation with a fun icebreaker and then encourage you to take a remote coffee (or donuts!)
together.

The Donut can take any form you want, but usually it's a 10-20 minutes video call where you can talk
about whatever's on your mind—it doesn't have to be work. In fact, most people use it to catch
up about their hobbies, families, and personal lives, and to get to know colleagues in other
teams/departments.

If you're a remote worker, Donut is an excellent way to socialize with the rest of the team. If you
work from an office, it's still great to get to know everyone else—in this case, you can "ban"your
co-located colleagues so that Donut only pairs you with people you don't know as well.

If you haven't tried Donut yet and would like to participate in the next round of pairings, feel
free to join the #coffee channel on Slack!
