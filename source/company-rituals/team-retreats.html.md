title: Team retreats
---

Once a year we all meet somewhere in the physical world for our team retreat, which typically lasts
a week. Team retreats are an opportunity for us to recharge and spend some quality time together—we
make sure our partners know that we won't be available during this time except for emergencies.

As the company grows, team retreat logistics have become increasingly more challenging. Luckily,
we have amazing people who work tirelessly to make them a smooth and unforgettable experience. You
can expect to get plenty of instructions about what to do before and during your trip, and you can
always reach out if you have any questions or issues.

Once we've arrived at our destination, we get settled into the hotel, and then the fun begins. We
have a mix of individual relax and group activities, and each day is usually packed with a few
different options you can choose from, depending on your mood and how adventurous you feel. Whenever
possible, we even rent a co-working space so that we can hack together, if we feel like it.

In order for the activities to not get overwhelming, we also leave plenty of room in the schedule
where you can explore the venue or just chill, either on your own or with some colleagues, if you
can manage to get them out of their sunbeds.

All of our team retreats so far have been amazing, and people talk about them for years. Our [most
recent retreat](https://retreat.nebulab.com/) was in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands—we surfed,
attempted and failed mulitple yoga poses, took crazy catamaran cruises, visited dunes and volcanos
and ate lots of _paella_. You can watch a glimpse of it

one!
