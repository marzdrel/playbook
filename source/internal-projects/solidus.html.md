title: Solidus
---

While we maintain [a bunch](https://github.com/nebulab) of small open-source libraries, none of them
can be compared to the scale and impact of [Solidus](https://solidus.io).

Solidus is an open-source eCommerce framework based on Ruby on Rails, specifically aimed at brands
that want to heavily customize their eCommerce experience rather than going with a more traditional
SaaS solution such as Shopify. Solidus provides the foundation of your eCommerce business, but
allows you to fully customize and replace any aspects of it.

We didn't originally develop Solidus, but rather we inherited it from the community, and we work on
it along with [the rest](https://opencollective.com/solidus) of the agencies and brands that use it
on a daily basis. All of our work is free and open-source, and it's our way of saying thank you and
[giving back to the community](/about-us/north-stars#community).

Because the vast majority of our work is with Solidus, we have a dedicated team working on the
product full-time, and we also lead any marketing and business-related initiatives around the
platform. The project's roadmap is based on the feedback we receive from the community as well as
the needs of the brands that we work withâ€”this ensures that everything we do has a real use case
rather than just being a thought experiment.

Working with Solidus is as challenging as it is rewarding: the ecosystem is _huge_, and improving it
without disrupting the workflow of existing users is a fun and stimulating experience. All of our
engineers are encouraged to contribute to Solidus with tweaks and improvements, but you can also hit
up your manager to inquire about the possibility of working on the platform full-time!
