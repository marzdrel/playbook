All teammates are welcome and encouraged to contribute to our [blog](https://nebulab.com/blog). This
is a space for us to share our thoughts and learnings, as well as to refine our understanding of
complex topics: you only truly understand something once you can explain it to someone else!

There are no strict guidelines on which topics to write about on the blog: we talk about software
development, design, eCommerce, leadership and anything else that seems like it might be a good fit.
As a rule of thumb, we try to keep our articles short and practicalâ€”long-form and thought
leadership pieces are still welcome, but not a requirement. If you're unsure whether something might
make a good blog post, ping the #blog channel in Slack and ask for advice!

We also keep a running list of blogpost ideas, and everyone is free to pick one and start writing
about it. This is very useful if you want to write a blogpost but lack the inspiration, or have a
great idea for a blogpost but simply lack the time to execute on it. Just make sure to coordinate
with each other and capture the original intent behind each blogpost.
