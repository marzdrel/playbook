title: Time tracking
---

Full-time teammates at Nebulab work a standard 40-hour week, with 10% of those hours devoted to
[Investment Time](/personal-growth/investment-time).

We use [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com) to clock in and out of the office. Because we're
distributed, clocking in obviously has a more abstract meaning, and generally means that you're
around and actively at work—e.g., you don't need to clock out for small breaks, but you do need to 
clock out for lunch. If you're an employee, you can find more documentation about the proper usage
of Factorial in Notion.

Our schedules are fairly flexible: as long as you can get work done efficiently and have some
overlap with your teammates, feel free to work at whatever times suit you best. While the majority
of people work their local 9-to-6 (i.e., 8 hours of work and a 1-hour lunch break), we also have
teammates working early in the morning and/or late in the afternoon, so that they can spend more
time with their family.

Finally, all team members get a "schedule flexibility" PTO allowance of up to 104 hours per year,
depending on length of service. This allows you to come in a little late or leave a little early
without eating into your vacation PTO or having to compensate with overtime.

## Billable hours

In addition to clocking in and out, we also use [Harvest](https://harvestapp.com) to keep track of
any time we spend working for clients or on Solidus, as well as any
[Investment Time](/personal-growth/investment-time) we use. This allows us to bill clients more
accurately and keep track of budgets.

Whatever time you track in Harvest on a client's project will show up in the client's invoice at the
end of the month, so make sure that you track accurately! If you're unsure whether a particular task
is billable or not, you're encouraged to reach out to your manager and find out.

## Schedule-based vs. outcome-based work

You might be wondering why we focus so much on the _hours_ people work, rather than the _outcome_ of
their work, which is the standard for most companies nowadays. Everyone seems to be touting the
benefits of letting people work however much they want as long as they're productive, so what gives?

This was a deliberate decision, and not one we have taken lightly. Having clear schedules has worked
best for us so far, for a few different reasons.

First of all, you're not always in control of your work environment when you're a consulting
firm. The majority of people at Nebulab work for external clients on long-term engagements. Having
a defined time commitment helps us set clear expectations with clients around the availability of
their team, so that a client is not expecting an engineer to jump on a call at 3 in the morning
just because they have a "flexible" schedule.

This takes us to the second reason, which has to do with work-life balance.

We have found our current setup to lead to a much healthier work-life balance than an
outcome-centric arrangement. If you're judged by the outcome of your work, how do you know _when
to stop?_ When you're only expected to work 40 hours/week, you just need to do your absolute best
in those 40 hours. We'll obviously pay overtime, but no one will compliment you for working more—in
fact, we'll often treat it as a symptom of an underlying issue.

Finally, there's some bureaucratic/administrative issues with not having a work schedule. The most
obvious: if you don't have a schedule, you can't be paid overtime. There are also additional caveats
with local employment laws in the countries where we hire employees directly, rather than as
contractors.

With that said, this decision is one we are constantly thinking about and re-evaluating, since
it's a pretty significant deviation from what most companies do. At some point, we might very well
change our minds about it—right now, we're confident that it's the best possible setup for the team.
